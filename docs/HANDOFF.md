# HANDOFF — CGPE Connect (Android) — Voice assistant track — 2026-08-29

> This session built the **voice assistant** end-to-end on the app side, produced the n8n + backend
> specs, and then **totally redesigned the voice UI to be "heavy"** (Skia glossy orb + frosted glass +
> Lottie-ready + male/female toggle). Everything is pushed to `aaziko/Shivam`; gates green throughout;
> **no APK built (owner: build ONE at the very end, after the backend proxy + all tasks).**
>
> ⚠️ **A PARALLEL session did the i18n Phase 85 work** (home-dashboard header translations) in this same
> checkout — see memory `phase85-home-headers-i18n-2026-08-29` and `docs/PHASES.md`. History is linear;
> both coexist; nothing overridden. This HANDOFF is the voice track's snapshot.

## Done (observable)
- **The whole voice app-side works in code**: hold the floating mic → full-screen voice mode opens →
  record → POST to the backend proxy → show transcript + speak the reply → navigate on command. All the
  decision logic (`src/voice/*`) is unit-tested (**npm test 1254**).
- **The voice mode is the heavy redesign**: a full-screen immersive surface (not a bottom sheet), a
  **glossy Skia liquid orb** that pulses with the real mic, **real frosted-glass** cards (expo-blur), a
  **male/female toggle** (persisted), a mic-reactive waveform, five animated states, department + persona
  colours, and a reduced-motion + non-Skia fallback (gradient orb). Boot-safe: web export prerenders all
  46 routes clean after every native add.
- **The app is aligned to the LIVE n8n brain contract** — the brain sends `{success, reply_text, action}`
  (no `confidence`); the parser now treats absent confidence as *act*, accepts `success`, and speaks a
  `success:false` reason without navigating.
- **The backend task is filed** — `POST /api/voice/ask` (STT → brain → TTS) is in `contracts/INBOX.md`
  (top, to `cgpe-api`) with the full brief at `docs/spec/VOICE-BACKEND-PROXY-BRIEF.md`.
- **Deliverables handed to the owner**: the n8n dev brief, the backend proxy brief, and two visual
  artifacts (voice-mode preview + the n8n spec page).

## Files changed
- `src/voice/*` — the tested pure core: gate/resolve/session/response/routes/request/client/registry/dispatch.
- `src/ui/voice/*` — **NEW** heavy UI: VoiceMode, useVoiceTurn, VoiceCharacter, OrbSkia, OrbStatic, GlassCards, VoiceWaveform, PersonaToggle, VoiceModeContext, VoiceMascot(+`.web`), mascots.ts, voiceVisual.ts (+tests).
- `src/lib/voiceGraphics.ts` (+`.web`) — Skia/blur/lottie probes; `src/lib/voiceAudio.ts` — metering.
- `src/app/_layout.tsx` — mount VoiceModeProvider + `<VoiceMode/>`; `src/ui/VoiceLauncher.tsx` — opens voice mode.
- `src/voice/response.ts` (+test) — aligned to the live brain. Removed superseded `VoiceSheet.tsx` + `VoiceAvatar.tsx`.
- `package.json`/`package-lock.json` — `@shopify/react-native-skia 2.6.2`, `expo-blur ~57.0.2`, `lottie-react-native ~7.3.8` (+~10-16 MB; native rebuild).
- `src/i18n/index.tsx` (+test) — voice.* keys (parity 446).
- `docs/spec/{N8N-VOICE-DEV-BRIEF,VOICE-BUILD-SPLIT,VOICE-BACKEND-PROXY-BRIEF,N8N-VOICE-WORKFLOW-SPEC}.md` — voice specs.
- `contracts/INBOX.md` — the `/api/voice/ask` backend ask.

## Decisions made
- **Voice architecture = n8n text brain + backend STT/TTS** (owner overrode the Express-fat-registry recommendation for speed). Confirmed live: the brain is text-in/text-out.
- **Full heavy UI** (Skia + expo-blur + Lottie), **light glassmorphic aesthetic**, **Lottie + male/female toggle now**. **Mascot ART is owner-commissioned** — the premium orb is the character until the `.json` drops into `assets/voice/`.
- **Writes stay DARK** in v1 (`VOICE_WRITES_ENABLED=false`) — reads + navigate only.
- **No APK yet** — one build at the very end, after the backend proxy + all other tasks.

## Known broken / deliberately skipped
- **Voice does not round-trip yet** — the backend proxy (`/api/voice/ask`) is not built (filed to cgpe-api). Until it's up, the app records but has nothing to talk to.
- **The character is an orb, not a drawn mascot** — bespoke art is owner-commissioned; the Lottie slot + toggle are wired.
- **All visuals are device-unverified** — Skia/blur/metering/back-intercept need a real APK (EAS quota resets 1 Sep; existing account cannot build before then).
- **EAS Update (OTA) not added** — recommended; owner build decision.
- **The `vbk_` brain webhook secret was pasted in chat** — must stay server-side only; worth rotating.

## Next session starts here
- **Phase — voice go-live:** confirm the backend proxy is built (INBOX top ask), then wire the pre-1-Sep test APK OR the 1-Sep final build (existing account, same keystore).
- **First command:** `npm test` (expect 1254 green), then re-read `contracts/INBOX.md` for the cgpe-api reply on `/api/voice/ask`.
- **Watch out for:** the **lottie web-build trap** — `lottie-react-native`'s web renderer needs `@lottiefiles/dotlottie-react` (not shipped); it is neutralised by `VoiceMascot.web.tsx` + `voiceGraphics.web.ts` stubs. **Do not delete those stubs** or the web export (boot-safety gate) breaks. And never static-import Skia/blur/lottie from a route/boot file — they load only via the `hasSkia/hasBlur/hasLottie` probes + `React.lazy`.
